title: General Explanation and walkthrough

For these first couple of weeks working on the project with Dr. Tricas, we are mainly looking through the literature to see if there are any other people who have done the same thing as us. We did a literature review, with documents for each of us, and then combined them into one big document for our own reference. During this time, we have also been learning more about machine learning through various tutorials and also our work with a project called fishsound_finder. We were unable to get fishsound_finder to work well enough for our needs, so have shifted to making something of our own.
