### Meeting focus
*fishsound_finder* demo showed threshold issues in noisy files; need cleaner inputs.  
Dr Tricas will upload three new WAVs. Tanner presented his ML/AI survey.

### Assignments for next week

2. **Tool test:** analyze the provided audio with FishSound and summarise findings.

### Individual progress
- **Xavier:** refining *fishsound_finder* thresholds.  
- **Tanner:** completed detailed ML/AI/PCA/MDS memo.
